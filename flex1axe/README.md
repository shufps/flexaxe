# Flex1Axe
Testboard for 1 FlexAxe module.

**note**: The buck converter is actually to weak to drive a FlexAxe module at full 485MHz. 
300MHz works well. It's not recommended to manufacture the Flex1Axe for commercial use. Is't just for testing FlexAxe modules after assembly before they are put into voltage chaining on the Flex4Axe
to minimize risk of not properly soldered ASICs causing a bad voltage domain balancing that could, in worst case, kill other ASICs.
